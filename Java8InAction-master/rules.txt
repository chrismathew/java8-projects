primary
	consAssocType will be always null
	file type can be physical, hybrid, electronic or disconnect( No digitized type in primary)
	 	if primary -> physical or hybrid, consAssocType can be association or consolidation
	 	if primary -> electronic, consAssocType will only have association
	    if primary -> disconnect, consAssocType will only have disconnect
	    
	    
	 Can we have disconnect send as seperate call, meaning only when the
	 primary is disconnect, and not mix up with consolidation and assocations
	 as i think doing both transactions of consolidating and un consolidationg
	 in the same transaction will cause issue on our side.
