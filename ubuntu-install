guinsert the ubuntu iso and install. add 16 gb memory, 50 gb space, 2 cpu
make it bidirectional by going to general --> advanced
insert the guest additions from devices on the top

sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms
cd /media/chris/VBox_GA
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAddtions.run
reboot

do the shared folder
sudo usermod -G vboxsf -a $USER
if the above command not executed, the shared folder would not show up, if vboxsf is not
installed, the above command will not run nor show any error.
To install vboxsf, do the following below
lsmod | grep vbox

$ sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
reboot
1) doing this makes the file transfer between shared folder and also makes the screen size
changable and better
2) in vmware there is no guest additions, but changing the video card memory to 256 mb makes
the screen size adjustable and better.

sudo apt install docker docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker chris
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
